    About Me</h3>
    <p>Iam a lazy guy.
      Laziness is something that every person has to a bigger or lesser extent. Some people have it to a much, much bigger extent, though. We are used to considering it as a bad thing. However, what if it is not? What if laziness actually helps to become more successful? I bet many of you would like this approach. Actually, many lazy people achieve huge success. History gives us many vivid examples. For instance, Charles Darwin was incredibly lazy. His teachers and parents suffered a lot making him learnt grammar and math at school; often he fell asleep right at the middle of the lesson. He preferred fishing and shooting crows to doing sports and when he was a college student, he spent most of the time in pubs. Even when he got into science, he didn’t rush things and spent years writing his work.Another example is sir Winston Churchill. At school he showed the worst result in class and didn’t even go to college. He was absolutely indifferent to sport and his favourite activity was sitting on a rocking chair. Afterwards he became a great politician.

        Carl Marks lived at the expense of his poor mother, partied for months and didn’t want to work at all. Then he lived on Engel’s money. All in all, his study has overthrew the established views of the whole world.
